# SHARP web app

## Goal of the project
To assess the resilience of farms, the app "SHARP" developed by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) was used so far. SHARP is used in many parts of the world. The aim of this project is to adapt this application to the Swiss context, then to be tested and validated by agricultural experts in Switzerland.

## CONTEXT
Climate change is a major source of uncertainty and risk for Vaudois agricultural exploitations. Durable consequences over time (eg. overall increase in temperatures), repeatedly (eg. droughts) as well as extreme weather events (eg. floods) affect agriculture which today must adapt to face this changing context.
The latest events in relation to the agricultural policy reflect both a desire to maintain a Swiss agriculture and a willingness of some actors to open the market a little bit more. This causes great uncertainty about the future of Swiss politics and agricultural markets.

## ISSUES
Faced with these many uncertainties, Vaudois farms must, in order to maintain themselves, to have a good resilience. In other words, they must be able to withstand fluctuations and natural events sometimes unexpected. Strengthening farm resilience aims to strengthen their adaptability to ensure that Vaudois agriculture maintains its diversity and its multiple functions (food production, landscape maintenance, rural employment, etc.).

## PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
This study aims to evaluate the resilience of Vaudois farms, that is to assess their adaptability, in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses against climatic and politico-economic hazards. The weaknesses identified are the subject of collective discussions between farmers in order to better know and to disseminate the tracks of the existing solutions.
